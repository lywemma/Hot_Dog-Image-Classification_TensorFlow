# Hot_Dog-Image-Classification_TensorFlow

Inspired by the hot dog-identifying app from HBO's Silicon Valley, I used TensorFlow to do the image identification for hot dog and not hot dog. The image dataset is downloaded from Kaggle (seefood.zip), which has images for hot dog and other food. 

I had 498 images in the training dataset for hot dog and not hot dog. To get a better model, I flipped the images in the training data. The model got 0.72 accuracy for the validation data and 0.82 accuracy for the testing data.

To further test the accuracy of this model, I randomly downloaded some food images online. It got correct identification for these images.

The model and results are showed in the jupyter notebook: [Hot_Dog Image Identification](https://github.com/lywemma/Hot_Dog-Image-Identification_TensorFlow/blob/master/Hot_Dog%20Image%20Identification.ipynb)
